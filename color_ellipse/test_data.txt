here we go on some test data


From 
small circle width
2 feet away = 185 pixels
3 feet away = 120 pixels
4 feet away = 90 pixels
5 feet away = 72 pixels
6 feet away = 58 pixels
7 feet away = 49 pixels
8 feet away = 44 pixels
9 feet away = 37 pixels
10 feet away = 33 pixels

H=0-18 and 150-255 , 98-255 and 23-255

scratch all that small circle data
whole hoop
2 feet away height 1200
3 feet away height 480 ish
4 feet away height is 370 ish
5 feet away height is 300 ish
6 feet away height is 255 ish
7 feet away height is 225 ish
8 feet away height is 190 ish
9 feet away height is 167 ish
10 feet away height is 152 ish
0-5 and 155-255, 98 to 255 and 23 to 255
